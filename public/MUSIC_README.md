# Background Music

To add background music to the anniversary site, place an MP3 file named `bg-music.mp3` in this directory.

The music will:
- Play in the background when toggled on via the music button in the top-right corner
- Have a volume level of 0.3 (30%)
- Loop continuously
- Support fade in/out transitions

Recommended music:
- Soft instrumental or classical pieces
- Anime-inspired soundtracks
- Romantic piano compositions
- Japanese traditional music

The music toggle is gracefully hidden during the password gate (initial unlock screen) for a clean aesthetic.
